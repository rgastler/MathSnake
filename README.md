This is a version of snake modified to give students practice with basic math facts.  Specifically adding and subtracting integers.  Credit goes to the YOuTube channel, "Coding With Adam", for the awesome tutorial. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Azlj0f9vas)  I learned a ton by following this tutorial and then modified it heavily to include some math with various levels.  Try it out!
